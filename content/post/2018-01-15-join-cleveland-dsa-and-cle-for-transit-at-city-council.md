Cleveland DSA joins Clevelanders for Public Transit in demanding that the Cleveland City Council take action to open Public Square to Transit. We encourage everyone to join us Monday, January 9, 2017 at 6:30 pm at the City Council Meeting, 601 Lakeside Avenue, to voice our demand that the city open the dedicated transit lanes in Public Square.

Mayor Frank Jackson’s unilateral decision to close Public Square to transit, in spite of the dedicated transit lanes built into the design of Public Square, continues to cause delays, missed connections to buses, and longer walks for over 40,000 riders daily. Re-routing buses around the Square continues to snarl traffic, adding millions of turns for the buses and additional costs of $1.6 million dollars to a transit agency already loosing funding. The Mayor’s decision has been repudiated by members of the City Council, transit riders’ organizations, and unions representing public transit workers. Most recently the Federal Transit Authority has notified the city that it is in violation of the funding terms for the grants that built the HealthLine, so Mayor Jackson’s actions jeopardize this $12 million grant and future funding from federal sources.

Cleveland DSA urges everyone to contact their City Council representatives about this issue. Please join us Monday, January 9, 2017 at 6:30 pm at the City Council Meeting to show support for Clevelanders for Public Transit and demand Public Square be opened for Public Transit.
